## Rec Foundry

### About
This is a Foundry for sports and recreational gyms. Often, finding balanced and 
organized pickup basketball games can be difficult. Team matchups can be uneven, 
and there's often no clear system of determining who's next on the court.

This system, built on the Palantir AIP and Foundry, maintains athlete profiles, gym occupancy, and virtual queues for more organized and fair games.
